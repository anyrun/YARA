# YARA

This repository contains a curated collection of YARA rules designed to detect a wide range of malware families, phishing campaigns, and other malicious artifacts. 

The rules are regularly updated to reflect the latest malware trends observed in the wild, with a focus on accuracy and reducing false positives. 

This project is intended for:  

- Malware researchers — to speed up classification and detection of samples.  
- Threat hunters and SOC analysts — to enrich detection capabilities and incident response.  
- Security engineers — to integrate YARA detection logic into larger defense systems.
